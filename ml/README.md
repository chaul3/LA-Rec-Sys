## Machine Learning Pipeline


<a name="headers4"/> Description:

This project is a machine learning-based recommender system implemented in Python 3.0 using Jupyter 
Notebook. The system uses several libraries, including pandas, numpy, recommenders, sklearn, pickle, 
and pymongo. It is based on the example provided by Microsoft's recommenders repository, 
which can be found at [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders.)

To use the system, it is recommended that you first read the tutorial provided by the repository's 
author to get a better understanding of the system's workings. Once you have done that, 
you can run the Jupyter Notebook provided in this project, which includes the data processing and model training steps.


The output model is saved in the same folder as 'finalized_model.sav'. 
List of used model is SAR, RBM, RLRMC. You can use other predefined or other model in sklearn.
This file can be used to generate recommendations for new users or items.

We hope this project will be useful for anyone looking to implement a machine 
learning-based recommender system in their own projects.
